## Derived Variables

The following variables are derived from the raw data:

### SSRT (Stop-Signal Reaction Time)

SSRT is calculated using the integration method:
1. Go RTs are rank-ordered
2. The nth RT is identified, where n = number of go trials Ã— probability of responding on stop trials
3. SSRT = nth go RT - mean SSD

### Post-Error Slowing

Calculated as the difference between:
- Mean RT on go trials following a stop-failure trial
- Mean RT on go trials following a correct go trial

## Quality Control

Records are flagged for exclusion if they meet any of these criteria:
- Go accuracy < 80%
- Stop accuracy outside 20%-80% range
- SSRT < 50ms or > 500ms
- More than 10% of trials with RT < 100ms

## Preprocessing Steps

1. Removal of practice trials
2. Removal of trials with RT < 100ms (anticipatory responses)
3. Removal of RT outliers (>3SD from participant's mean)
4. Calculation of summary statistics and derived measures
5. Application of QC criteria and exclusion flagging

## Usage Notes

- For group comparisons, use the 'excluded' variable to filter out problematic data
- SSRT is the primary measure of inhibitory control
- Consider age as a covariate in all analyses
