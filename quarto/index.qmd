# Overview {.unnumbered}

This document contains progress reports for the NIH-funded research grant "Understanding Neural Mechanisms of Cognitive Control in Neurodevelopmental Disorders" (Grant #XXXXXXX). These reports document the research progress, significant findings, challenges, and future directions of our project.

## Project Summary {.unnumbered}

Cognitive control deficits are a core feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. This research aims to characterize the neural mechanisms of cognitive control across typical development and in neurodevelopmental disorders, specifically attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Our specific aims are:

1. **Characterize developmental trajectories of neural circuits supporting cognitive control**
2. **Identify disorder-specific neural signatures of cognitive control deficits**
3. **Determine the relationship between neural network dynamics and individual differences in cognitive control abilities**

## Navigation {.unnumbered}

Use the navigation panel on the left to access different sections of the report. The main content is organized as follows:

- [Progress Report](progress-report.qmd): Detailed summary of research activities, findings, and future plans
- [Bibliography](bibliography.qmd): Publications and presentations resulting from this research
- [Appendix A](appendix-a.qmd): Technical details of data collection and analysis methods
- [Appendix B](appendix-b.qmd): Supplementary analyses and additional figures

## Report Generation Information {.unnumbered}

These reports were generated using Quarto, a scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. This allows for the creation of dynamic documents that combine narrative text with R code for data analysis and visualization.

The source code and data for these reports are maintained in a version-controlled repository following best practices for reproducible research. Each report includes:

- Transparent documentation of methods and analyses
- Dynamic generation of figures and tables from the raw data
- Literate programming approach that combines code, results, and interpretation

## Data Management {.unnumbered}

All research data supporting these progress reports are managed according to the Data Management Plan approved by NIH. This includes:

- Secure storage of all raw and processed data
- Comprehensive documentation of data collection and processing procedures
- Rigorous quality control measures
- Preparation for data sharing in accordance with NIH guidelines
