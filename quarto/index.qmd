# Welcome

This document serves as a central hub for NIH Grant Progress Reports. This Quarto project enables you to:

1. Create standardized progress reports following NIH guidelines
2. Include R code, data visualization, and statistical analyses
3. Generate both HTML and PDF outputs with consistent formatting
4. Manage references efficiently using BibTeX

## Navigation

- [Progress Report](progress-report.qmd): Detailed project progress and accomplishments
- [Bibliography](bibliography.qmd): Complete list of references cited in progress reports
- [Appendix A](appendix-a.qmd): Supplementary materials and additional analyses
- [Appendix B](appendix-b.qmd): Extended data tables and figures

## Getting Started

To create a new progress report, you can use the `progress-report.qmd` as a template. The template includes:

- YAML front matter with appropriate formatting options
- Pre-loaded R libraries for data visualization
- Sections structured according to NIH progress report requirements
- Citation capabilities linked to the bibliography

## Using This Template

1. Clone or copy the `progress-report.qmd` file
2. Update the YAML front matter with your grant information
3. Fill in each section with your project-specific information
4. Add references to `references/progress-report-refs.bib`
5. Render the document using Quarto:

```bash
quarto render progress-report.qmd
```
